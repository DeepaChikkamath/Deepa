        <h3>What it does to you</h3>

        <p>
            It was another summer vacation, two years ago. I wanted to make my mind spacious after exploring some thoughts of the self, who I am, who I might have been, who I might become. I always knew the importance of mindfulness, but had not given meditation a fair shot. 
            The self, <b>I</b>, just am. Nothing is <b>mine</b>. I simply <b>am</b>. (Highly esoteric, I know). Where is this <b>me</b> 'located'? I have been exploring this for a very long time. I tried to look inward, and there was nothing.
            Just like we know the source of an electrically positive charge, we can't see the source of our thought. 
            Esentially think of your attention or focus like light. If you look back at where its coming from, do you 'see' the source? No. Because that is where you are.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is when I came across the headless-way. Literally had so many life changing experiences while meditating after that. But won't go into those details. But essentially, it is like incresing the exposure time on you camera.
            or the frames per second. You feel more, think clearly, process faster and easier. It is like taking vitamin pills but with endless benefits (literally). You will become more aware of your surrounding, more aware of people,

        </p>

        <p>
            I meditate mostly everyday. Sometimes more than once. Sometimes it feels great, and sometimes it does not. Days feel more full, longer infact. Because I am not on any routine, I was simply there, in that moment, fully immersed in that moment like a baby.
            My career, work, everything is just more. In simple terms, an alternate title to this journal entry would be, <b>I am more me when I meditate</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am not trying to look like I have everything together while I talk about this. I know people find it really hard to meditate. But I am incredibly grateful that it came naturally to me after I started, which was definitely the hardest part.
            I know people most of us, as soon as we start doing something, we are thinking of what to do next. Maybe the next step in a problem, the next question, the next chapter, the next chore, the next task or about when this thing is going to be done. Or we might think of something from the past.
            But meditating unlike popular opinion, is not sitting with your back straight, closing your eyes and focusing on how you breath. That is just a way of doing it. It is about being all there, where ever you are. You are putting on socks? Just put on socks, don't think of shoes nor about putting socks on the other leg. That is, in a way being mindful of what you are doing.
            And notice your days being longer after that. 
        </p>
        <p>I incorporate pauses in my day whenever I can. This is just a couple of seconds where I become extra aware of awareness and look inward.</p>
        <p>

            This is going to be raw, not filtered or edited. This is my journal entry a couple days ago.

            <hr>
            
            Life was a haze in the two months leading up to July. I often found myself wondering about the true meaning of my life and what I really want. 
            After finishing my 4th year in college, that feeling had pretty much sky-rocketed while I was at home. Meanwhile I was also going through some pretty rough times and
            that was not a great combination. 
            I found myself in a rut and always overthinking. My days were a simple, joyless cycle: wake up, work, sleep. But this was summer, 
            so I atleast wanted to rest peacefully, and I could not do that either. I did not enjoy my life like I used to. 
            I was in a really frustrating place of wondering <em>what is wrong with me?</em> and being absolutely unaware of life 
            which in turn led to me being more lost. This began as soon as I finished my exams. I did not tell a soul. I think 
            I could not bare to realise these feeligns at all. I could not bare to sit with these emotions, which put me off of 
            my schedule to indulge in activities that would not require being present. I did what was necessary and nothing more.

        </p>

        <h3>not meditating for two months</h3>

        <p>
            I had stopped meditating by the time I went back home for vacation. This is when I started to see the consequences of not meditating. 
            I was more frustrated at things (normally, nothing frustrates me. I see life as an experience that I am simply observing and not something that is 
            happening <em>to me</em>), I was more reactive towards everything, I stopped eating well, I constantly stayed up in my head and not my heart, 
            I overthought <em>literally</em> everything. Most importantly, I stopped doing things that made me happy, made me <em>me</em>. I did not sketch, paint, 
            journal, play chess, cycle. It got to the point where I started expecting things from people in my life. I expected them to help me. I started 
            letting fear take over. I slowly got comfortable with not being okay, not trying anything new, decreased confidence in myself (which was nearly unbreakable).
        </p>
        <p>
            And I love love. But that faded because I was never really here. I found flaws everywhere. Before, I used to find beauty in imperfection; a perfectly flawed thing somehow felt better than a perfect thing, 
            therefore perfect. Now, I couldn’t even step outside to smell flowers.
        </p>

        

        <p>
            As someone who used to fall asleep the second I put my head on a pillow, I stayed up staring at the ceiling, overthinking about things. One day, 
            I had to make a pretty big decision, I could not sleep till 4 AM. I felt anxious the whole time and did not even make a decision.  (Oh also, when I did not meditate and had added stress, my skin broke out like never before. I had new scars everyday!) I knew I had to change something, and it was not going to work this way.
            Things worked out at this point, I started living in a new city, started a thesis and thing change influenced all other changes in me.
        </p>


        <p>
            The more I think about it, I think I did not meditate because I could not sit with my own hard feelings and emotions. I was afraid of facing it, and everything seemed so  
            hard at the time. Even breathing. But as soon as the hard times in my life changed (literally all of it worked out in two weeks after 2 months of suffering), I was suddenly more aware.
            I was just <em>more</em>. I could feel the breeze on my skin again. I loved my hair more.
            And I thought, this is the perfect time to start again (<em>Now</em> is always the perfect time to start) and closed my eyes. To my surprise, I was not as great as I was before.
            I did not feel anything profound. It definitely made me feel calm, but it just was not right.
        </p>

        <h3>
            why meditate
        </h3>

        <p>
            I think most of what we "go through" mentally is because of an untrained mind. Just like your body needs exercise, your mind needs mindfulness. We were meant to experience every moment fully, just like you did when you were a baby.
            You are meant to live a full life where you feel the days, and you essentially feel like you lived for an eternity. Mindfulness is getting your mind jacked with six packs. Just like you build a new habit, say of making your own coffee, you build a muscle memory overtime.
            You dont even have to conciously make decisions about it. Forbidding yourself from a bad habit seems normal. But have your ever forbidden yourself from a bad thought or a feeling? It feels odd, and uncontrollable, doesn't it? But turns out,
            it is controllable. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I still do not understand how people go through their days without meditating. I do not understand how I did it before I started meditating. I console myself saying that they are incredibly mindful of everything and are basically meditating all the time.
            Because once I started meditating, it became an inherent part of me. I just was in it most of the time. I did not have to actively bring myself to meditate. It is never a chore for me. It is so natural. It just happens. I am very much less reactive and just observe things pass by.
            I can get into a <em>flow state</em> anytime I want because I meditate. ("You may have experienced a flow state at some point
             that sense of fluidity between your body and mind, where you are totally absorbed by and deeply focused on something, beyond the point of distraction. 
             Time feels like it has slowed down. Your senses are heightened. You are at one with the task at hand, as action and awareness sync to create an effortless 
             momentum. Some people describe this feeling as being “in the zone.” This is the flow state and it’s accessible to everyone, whether you’re engaged in a physical 
             activity, a creative pursuit, or even a simple day-to-day task." - <a href="https://www.headspace.com/articles/flow-state">source</a>) 
            

        </p>
        <p>
            Getting back into that flow 
        </p>

        

        <p>That is still affecting me to this day. I am not doing things that are a little scary even though I know the fruit will be sweet. 
            I am very grateful that I have come out of that phase of my life and being in Paris and working at Laboratory PMMH has really been the push that I needed, 
            and somehting that has been helping me get back on track. I still feel the after storm of that storm sometimes and it does get hard, but I am doing so much 
            better right now.
